# Repository overview

This repository contains questionnaires for auxiliary data collection in studies.
Under `data`, a PDF contains an overview of the `Wear log`, `Morning sleep diary`,
`Light exposure and activity diary`, `Exercise diary`, and `Experience log`

# Purpose

Wearable light loggers and optical radiation dosimeters are increasingly used in 
chronobiology and circadian-health research. Yet their data often lack essential 
contextual information (e.g., non-wear periods, sleep, environment) and may be 
compromised by compliance or device issues. To enhance utility and accuracy, 
this work established an auxiliary data framework and corresponding tools.

# Auxiliary Data Framework

The questionnaire is structured around six domains:
	1.	Wear / Non-wear logging
	2.	Sleep monitoring
	3.	Light-source context
	4.	Participant behaviour
	5.	User experience

# Getting Started
	1.	Clone or download this repository.
	2.	Review the questionnaire (.pdf) and adapt to your study context. REDCap exports of the questionnaires allow for easier implementation.
	3.	Administer the questionnaire alongside your wearable light logger deployment.
	4.	Use the tools and templates in this repo to integrate and QC your data.
	5.	Credit the original study (Zauner et al. 2025) when using or adapting the framework.
